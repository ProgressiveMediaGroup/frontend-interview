# Progressive Content: Front-end Technical Test
This project is used as a technical test when interviewing potential front-end web developers for Progressive Content.

## Installation Instructions
This is part of the test :)

## Task Instructions
We need you to:

1. Add a new page called 'messages' with the route of '/messages'

2. Add the page into the current navigation and ensure it conforms to the design (supplied within the /design-assets/ folder)

3. Request data from the following API endpoint when the '/messages' route is loaded: /api/messages.json

4. Create a widget conforming to the specification/design (supplied within the /design-assets/ folder)

5. Create a list on the '/messages' page, showing and populating a widget for each item within the JSON supplied from the API

6. Ensure the ordering of the list is in date order, with the latest appearing at the top

## Hints and Tips
We are looking for a familiarity with JS, React and the various modules supplied with the project.

This project is built using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project.

We will also be assessing the code supplied for errors, cleanliness and maintainability.

It should be noted that any code provided will be used as a discussion point for the next interview round, so a clear understanding of the initial project and its supporting structure may be useful ;)

Bonus points will also be awarded for any valid suggestions on improvements within the supplied code.

This test should take between 1 and 2 hours, although this is purely a guide.

## Submission Instructions
To package your working files, please run the following command:

```npm run package```

This will bundle and zip the 'package.json' file and everything in the 'src' and 'public' folders into the 'package.zip' archive.

Please ensure the zip contains all your files.

Please submit the package.zip file to: [Chris Williams](christopher.williams@progressivecontent.com)
